# MATH4025 Capstone Project

Code developed for use in research analyzing how the upcoming MBTA GLX project will impact traffic in surrounding communities.  See the abstract below:

"The intent of this project is to model impacts to traffic congestion that the new MBTA expansion into Medford will have on neighborhoods surrounding the newly built Green Line stations.  This is done by defining and calculating a metric that is denoted here as traffic score, as well as by determining characteristics that make an intersection unique.  These two data sets are then used to create pairs of intersections that are similar, which allow for the use of regression modeling. This methodology yields results that are consistent with the claim that these new stations will not impact surrounding traffic conditions."
